HTML/Template/Filter/Dreamweaver version 1.02
=============================================

 Dreamweaver MX has updated their templating code fairly heavily, and 
 now it supports many of the things that HTML::Template does.
 
 For example, you can define template variables, repeating sections, use 
 conditional logic, etc.  I'll try to give a quick summation here, but 
 in all honesty, you would do better by browsing Macromedia's website, 
 downloading the trial version. or buying a book on it.
 
 Dreamweaver allows you to set up a template file (it ends in an 
 extension called .dwt).  You can then use this template to create HTML 
 files where you change the pre-defined parameters of the template.
 
 Some examples:
 Dreamweaver MX prefers that all variables in the template be named at 
 the top of the .dwt HTML.  This is done by using the <!-- TemplateParam 
 --> tag.  You can define a default for the parameters and you also 
 define the type of variable (e.g. boolean, text, number, etc.)
 
 In the HTML of the template, you can then use your variables in syntax 
 like <!-- TemplateExpr expr="foo" --> or @@(foo)@@.  This is analagous 
 to the <TMPL_VAR> syntax of HTML::Template
 
 Another Dreamweaver tag is the <!-- TemplateBeginIf --> and <!-- 
 TemplateEndIf --> tags.  These are similar to the <TMPL_IF> and 
 </TMPL_IF> tags.
 
 Also, there are <!-- TemplateBeginRepeat --> and <!-- TemplateEndRepeat 
 --> tags.  As you can guess, these are similar to the <TMPL_LOOP> and 
 </TMPL_LOOP> tags.
 
 There's also a few more tags, but as you can see Dreamweaver MX 
 supports syntax very similar to HTML::Template.
 
 Finally, for seeing what the page would look like when you populate the 
 variables, Dreamweaver allows you to create an HTML page using the 
 template as a starting point.  Under the "Modify" menu, there is a 
 choice that says "Template Properties".  In there, you can set 
 variables to whatever you like.  This is very similar to the param 
 function of HTML::Template.
 
 Personally, I think Dreamweaver MX is so close to HTML::Template that 
 it's possible for an HTML designer to use it and create great mockups 
 of pages.  After developing the mockup, he can give the template to an 
 HTML::Template user who can then combine it with his code to 
 dynamically fill in the template variables.
 
 So, the package that I provided should create be an excellent transform 
 function for converting Dreamweaver template files into HTML::Template 
 files.
